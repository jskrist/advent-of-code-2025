# [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
This is a repository of my 2025 AoC solutions.  I started off doing this in python, and decided later to also complete them in Rust as a way to practice more Rust.

### Notes on Rust solutions
currently all solutions written in rust are being written as modules that are being called from the main.rs/main() function.  They should be able to be run with `cargo run` from the advent_of_code_2025 directory.  The expected solutions match the values in the python sections below, and the code files follow a similar naming convention.  The imput files are shared between python and Rust.

### Day 1
#### Part 1
solution file: `day_1_puzzle_1.py`  
input file: `day_1_puzzle_1_input.txt`  
expected solution: 46  
test file: `day_1_puzzle_1_test_1.txt`  
expected test solution: 0

#### Part 2
solution file: `day_1_puzzle_2.py`  
input file: `day_1_puzzle_1_input.txt`  
expected solution: 1030560  
test file: `day_1_puzzle_1_test_1.txt`  
expected test solution: 2
